Yes, when deploying to Heroku, you will need to ensure that your CSS files are properly compiled. This is especially important when using a CSS framework like Bootstrap, which includes Sass files that need to be compiled to CSS.

Here are some steps you can follow to ensure your Bootstrap CSS is compiled and served correctly in a production environment on Heroku:

1. **Install necessary dependencies**: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed in your project. This includes Bootstrap and any required loaders or compilers, such as `sass-loader` for Webpack¹.

2. **Configure your build process**: Configure your build process to compile your CSS during the build step. This can typically be done in your `package.json` file's `scripts` section, where you might have a script like `"build-css": "node-sass src -o dist"`¹.

3. **Set environment variables on Heroku**: By default, Heroku sets `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=true`, which means `devDependencies` will not be installed. Since you're doing some build steps at deploy time, you need some `devDependencies` (Bootstrap sources in your case). You can change this behavior by running the following command in your Heroku CLI: `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`¹. This will install your `devDependencies` and allow you to build your CSS.

4. **Precompile your assets**: In some cases, you might need to precompile your assets before deploying to Heroku. This can be done with a command like `rake assets:precompile`³.

5. **Serve static files**: Ensure that your server is configured to serve static files. In Express.js, for example, you would use something like `app.use(express.static('public'))` to serve static files from the `public` directory¹.

Remember, these steps might vary depending on your specific setup and configuration. If you're using a build tool like Webpack or Parcel, you'll need to ensure that it's properly configured to compile your CSS¹. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
